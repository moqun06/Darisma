        I can say without a semblance of a doubt that Dara is a very beautiful young lady
        and also funny.
        She was born in Pennsylvania, U.S.A June 2005.
        She grew up in Lagos, Nigeria.
        Raised by African parents, Dara is a very cultured and inteliigent person.
        Dara is a very fun person to interact with, don't let the occasional cold face deceive you
        She's really Nice.
        Dara is very good in sports and board games, though i'd probably school her in chess.
        Amongst her freinds she's commonly reffered to as "Miss teapot,Daraboobkins!
        " or "FUNKE!!"
